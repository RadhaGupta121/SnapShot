# SnapShot
In this project ,I created the gallery which contains image of mountain,beach, birds, and food.
In  the gallery added some feature :
a.) We can filter the image ,my clicking on the category name, like if we want to see only mountain pics than we can click on mountain, it will results the mountain pics only.
b.) We can use the search box also for searching the image,like suppose you want to see the birds pic only than you can search by birds,it will result birds pics only.
Concept used in this project is of:
1.)Map
2.)useState
3.)useRef
This is the small project , which I created to refresh my concept on mapping,and useState and many other js topics, if you want to practice on react js and get stuck in thinking 
which project should get build , than you can definitely try this one.
This is my personal advice to you all, if you are beginner than go ahead with this project and do it by yourself,it will definitely help you.

Good Luck,
Thankyou
